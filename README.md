#### 🤖 To compile:
```
gcc "replce-this-with-your-compiling-file-name" func.c -o main -lcrypto -lsqlite3
```

> [!NOTE]  
> - You need, ```openssl``` library and ```sqlite3``` library.
> - If you still having trouble, you can open a codespace for the repo by ```Code -> Codespaces -> Create codespace on main```
> - `createdb.c` is for create the db tables.
> - `addsampledata.c` to add sample data to the tabels.
> - `testDB.c` is for understand how the function sql works, with **examples**.

#### 📜 More details:

`func.c` holds all major functions; if you add a new function, don't forget to add a function prototype to the `func.h` file as well.
In `main.c` we just use basic logic to call the functions so it doesn't get too crowded. And by doing that `main.c` will be much easier to read and understand the basic logic structure behind it.
